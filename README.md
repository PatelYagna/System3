# System 3.0
This is a simple operating system simulation program built using Python and Tkinter. 
The program provides basic functionalities such as: 
login, sign up, note creation, random number generation, a guessing game, coin flipping, a calculator, statistics calculator, and various stack operations.

## Features

- **Login and Sign Up:** Users can log in with their username and password or sign up for a new account.

- **Note Management:** Users can create, view, and delete notes. Notes are saved as text files.

- **Randomizer:** Generates a random number between 1 and 100.

- **Calculator:** Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation).

- **Statistics Calculator:** Computes various statistics such as variance, mean, median, mode, and harmonic mean.

- **Stack Operations:** Includes functionalities to check balanced parentheses, check for palindrome strings, convert infix expressions to postfix, and evaluate postfix expressions.

## Getting Started

if your system doesn't have tkinter install it by the following command:
pip install tkinter

After run the main program:
